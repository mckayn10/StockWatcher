Questions for Designer:

1. Regarding the "Add Stock" button, what styles should be implemented on Hover, on Press, etc..

2. How would should error messages be displayed? I used a popup alert, but would you rather have error text displayed directly on the page somewhere?

3. At what exactly what width should the break points be at?

4. How to handle the design of certain elements in between specified break points?
